    <p>When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than 20 years ago, he had no idea how successful it would become. One of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up more than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular lasagna recipes on the internet for two decades. Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old â€” read all about his life and legacy here.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Meat:</b>
            This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.
        </li>
        <li><b>Onion:</b>
            and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
        </li>
        <li><b>Tomato products:</b>
            You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
        </li>
        <li><b>Sugar:</b>
            Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
        </li>
        <li><b>Spices and seasonings:</b>
            This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
        </li>
        <li><b>Lasagna noodles:</b>
            Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
        </li>
        <li><b>Cheeses:</b>
            Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
        </li>
        <li><b>Egg:</b>
            An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.
